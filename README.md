# Hi there, I'm Ezequiel! 👋

I'm a university student studying web development and passionate about creating beautiful and functional websites. I have experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Tailwind, and some UX/UI design and WordPress development. I'm also familiar with some of the Adobe Suite tools, such as Photoshop and Illustrator. 🚀💻🎨

I enjoy designing and developing websites that are accessible, responsive, and user-friendly. I'm always looking to learn more and expand my skill set, whether it's through new technologies, techniques, or design trends. 🌟👨‍💻📈

While I don't have professional experience working as a web developer, I'm eager to gain real-world experience and collaborate on projects. I'm a hardworking and dedicated individual who is committed to producing high-quality work. 💪🏼👍🏼

If you're interested in collaborating on a web development project or just want to chat about anything related to web development, feel free to reach out to me. Let's build something amazing together! 😊🚀💻
